# Dust programming language
Ð¡ompiled, simple and imperative programming language. The compiler is made using LLVM. All tests were performed on Ubuntu Linux.

# Was done
- [x] Variable semantic
- [x] Let statement
- [x] Assign statement
- [x] Exit statement
- [ ] Print statement
- [ ] Const variables
- [ ] Adding and multiplication with priority
- [ ] If statement
- [ ] Loop statement
- [ ] Functions statement
- [ ] Etc...

## Getting started
Dependencies: LLVM-DEV, LLVM, C++20, GTest (not necessary)
1. Clone repository:
```bash
https://github.com/wandvvs/dust-lang
```
2. Choose dust-lang directory and build it
```bash
cd dust-lang/
cd build/
cmake ..
make
```
3. Test language
```bash
./dust-lang <input.dust>
```
## Grammar
```
program ::= statement_list

statement_list ::= statement | statement_list statement

statement ::= let_statement | assign_statement | exit_statement

let_statement ::= "let" identifier "=" expression ";"

assign_statement ::= identifier "=" expression ";"

exit_statement ::= "exit" "(" expression ")" ";"

expression ::= identifier | literal

literal ::= integer_literal

identifier ::= [a-zA-Z]+

integer_literal ::= [0-9]+
```

## Example
```
let a = 5;
let b = 10;

a = b;

let x = a;

x = 29;

exit(x);
```

Let`s compile it and run
```bash
./dust-lang input.dust
./out
```

LLVM IR:
```llvm
; ModuleID = 'dust_prog'
source_filename = "dust_prog"

define i64 @main() {
entrypoint:
  ret i64 29
}
```

Output:
```
29
```
